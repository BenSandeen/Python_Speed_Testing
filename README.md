# Python_Speed_Testing
Tested many different ways of doing things in Python to find out which were the
fastest.  I'm sure I've made mistakes in this file; please let me know if you
find any, so I may rectify them.  Thanks!

To run the script, first edit the script to run the specific comparison you wish
to test by commenting and uncommenting code as necessary, then navigate to the
directory with the `python_speed_testing.py` file in it and type:

    $ python python_speed_testing.py

Alternatively, if you have another Python interpreter, such as PyPy, you may use that:

    $ pypy python_speed_testing.py

*Please note that this will not work with any tests that uses NumPy, unless you have
specifically set up your computer to have the under-development PyPy implementation
of NumPy
